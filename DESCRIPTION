Description: R implementation of data fusion filters for Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) based on
    Vlad Maximov's GyroLib AHRS library (quaternion based linearized/extended/unscented Kalman filter,
    Euler based LKF, gyro-free with vector matching, SVD calibration and EKF calibration),
    Sebastian O.H. Madgwick AHRS algorithms and Sebastian O.H. Madgwick implementation of Mayhony et al AHRS algorithm.
